*Please don't make a PR adding tests!* I'm holding off for the imminent release
of the next `elm-test` version, so I can use the latest and greatest on this.

I debated waiting until the new `elm-test` had landed to open-source this, but
then I figured it'd be better to make what I already had available sooner
rather than later.

Thanks for your patience!
